# Text-generation

This project entails creating a Predictive Text Generation system using deep feedforward networks. The system will be designed to generate predictive text based on input data, mimicking human-like text generation. It will utilize deep learning techniques to learn from large datasets of text and predict the next words or sentences in a sequence.

We will use New Yorkâ€™s time comments dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains various articles and comments. Our objective is to load all the articles as headlines and merge them into a list.
            The data contains information about the comments made on the articles published in New York Times in Jan-May 2017 and Jan-April 2018. The month-wise data is given in two csv files - one each for the articles on which comments were made and for the comments themselves. The csv files for comments contain over 2 million comments in total with 34 features and those for articles contain 16 features about more than 9,000 articles.
